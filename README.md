Launch date of theater campaigns appear to play a significant role in the chances of success. Campaigns starting in late spring and early summer have the best chance of success and then taper off as the year progresses.

## Recommendation

A Kickstarter campaign is a good way to get the funding needed to launch your play. However, it might be wise to review your budget and reduce costs in order to increase your chances of success. Using volunteers as stage hands or getting costumes from thrift stores is just a couple of examples of way to possibly reduce costs. It is also recommended that you launch your campaign in late spring to further increase your chances of success. Please keep in mind that this data is drawn from a single crowdfunding source and there is no way to gauge the quality of the plays being presented. These facts could impact the rate of success.
