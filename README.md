## Outcomes of Kickstarter Projects Based on Launch Date and Goal Amount

This analysis looks at launch dates of Kickstarter campaigns for theater projects to determine if launch date impacts the success of the campaign. It further looks at established goal amounts set at the launch of the campaign, also to determine if goal amount impacts the probability of success.

### Purpose

The purpose of performing this analysis is to determine when is the most opportune time to launch a Kickstarter campaign for a theater project and if there is an optimal level to set the goal to increase the chances of success.

## Analysis and Challenges

To gather the data needed to make the launch date analysis, I created a pivot chart that sorted Kickstarter campaigns by launch month and outcome.  This allowed me to chart this data in a line graph that shows a clear picture of how many campaigns were launched each month and whether they were successful. Below I have shared an image of the pivot table and the chart will be shared with the launch date analysis. The challenging part of this analysis was sorting the months launched from the overall launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The time of the year when a Kickstarter campaign is launched has a noticeable impact on the success rate of the campaign. Campaigns launched in the late spring have the best chance of achieving the desired goal.  This trends down over the course of the remainder of the year. The best time to launch is between the end of April and the beginning of September.  Campaigns launched late in the year are much less likely to be successful. This is likely due to the holidays when people are dealing with the associated expenses.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
